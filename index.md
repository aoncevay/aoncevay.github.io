I'm a PhD student in the [Machine Translation](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/People) and 
[Edinburgh NLP](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/) groups at the University of Edinburgh, UK, 
under the supervision of [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/) 
and [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/).

My research focuses on low-resource natural language processing and machine translation.
Moreover, I am interested in integrating linguistic typology knowledge with NLP and
developing new corpora for under-represented languages.

I'm a co-founder of [Chana](chana.inf.pucp.edu.pe/), an interdisciplinary research group in Peru composed by linguists, 
computer scientists and other specialists. Our aim is to develop the NLP and Computational Linguistic 
fields in Peru, with emphasis in Amerindian languages. Currently, we are hosting a bi-weekly [reading club](https://github.com/aoncevay/lingcomp-nlp-meetups)
and preparing the 2nd [NLP Summer School](https://sites.google.com/view/nlp-iapucp-2020/) in 2021.
