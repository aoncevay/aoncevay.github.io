I'm a PhD student in the [Machine Translation](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/People) and 
[Edinburgh Natural Language Processing](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/) groups at the University of Edinburgh, UK, 
under the supervision of [Lexi Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/) 
and [Barry Haddow](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bhaddow/).

My research focuses on low-resource machine translation and NLP.
Moreover, I am interested in integrating linguistic typology knowledge with NLP and
developing new corpora for under-represented languages.

I'm also a co-founder of [Chana](https://github.com/aoncevay/lingcomp-nlp-meetups), an interdisciplinary group in Peru. 
Our aim is to develop the NLP and Computational Linguistic research in Peru and LatAm, 
with an emphasis on native languages of Peru and the Americas.

When I'm not doing research I like to walk aimlessly, listen to podcasts and take photos, specially of sunset time, spring or autumn.
